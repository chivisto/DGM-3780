# VueJs - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

For this assignment, we will be exploring The Vue Framework by building a simple exercise tracking app... 

## Exercise Tracking App Assignment -  Requirements

* Add Exercises to Track
  * Example exercises: Running (time), bench press (sets, reps, and weight)
* Track a user-entered exercise by time and distance or sets, reps, and weight amount
* See a history of past exercises and workouts with tracked stats
* Be able to set a date when the exercise was performed
* Must be hosted at a live URL

When complete, turn in a link to your Github classroom repo and the live-hosted URL The live site should be in the URL submission.

## Tips
* Work through the tutorial on the VueJS.org website.
* Note, the tutorial is good at examples and concepts, but not so great about how it all fits together.
* Use The Vue CLI to bootstrap your project
* Remember Vue is a framework, it is very opinionated about how you structure your app and implement your features.
* A database is not required for this assignment. You can just store the data in memory and lose the data on page refresh.
* I would recommend starting with a basic data model that is always there on page load.
  * If you do want to implement a sudo database, there are JSON APIs that could work very well such as: https://mockend.com (Links to an external site.) or https://fakejson.com (Links to an external site.)
